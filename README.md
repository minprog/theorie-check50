This repository has the check50 checks for the heuristics (or programmeertheorie) cases,
as well as an overview of the necessary changes that needed to be made to the original version of the course.

#### Setup check environment.
You must have python3 installed and a possibility for creating a virtual
environment. The example below uses the python3-venv package, but you can use
your own as well.

###### Install python packages.
`sudo apt-get install python3 python3-venv`

###### Create virtual environment and activate it.
```shell script
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

###### Install requirements.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


#### Run checks.
It is possible to run the check50 tests via the online version on GitHub, or
locally in a development environment. The different options are separated in 
sections. For all checks, you must be in the folder of the check itself. So
`cd` into the directory of the case you want to test. Let's
denote the folder name of the case as `<case>`.    

###### Run on the check50 servers.
You can run the checks on GitHub on the check50-servers by running the command:  
`check50 OkkeVanEck/check50_heuristieken/master/<case>`

###### Run locally
You can run the checks on GitHub locally by running the same command with the
`--local` flag specified:  
`check50 --local OkkeVanEck/check50_heuristieken/master/<case>`

###### Run local code
You can run your local version of a check by running `check50` with the 
`--dev` flag in the folder where the `.check50.yaml` is located:  
`check50 --dev .`


### Required case changes
There are some changes required for the cases. The changes are de described 
below, divided by case. For each case it will be necessary to write an 
explanation on how to use the check50.
