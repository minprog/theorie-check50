This file uses check50 to check the output of a RailNL solution. It does so by
executing the checks from the checks problem folder. The maximum time per
track and maximum number of tracks is changed according to the national problem.
It will also use the `stations.csv` and `connections.csv` files stored in the
national problem folder.
